ATTENTION: EXPERIMENTAL!
Made for personal use, but I will try to publish it as an extension soon.

## Reason
I'm migrating from Brackets to VS Code, but none of the themes available in the marketplace had the look and feel of the Delkos Dark Theme and I saw a huge drop in my productivity. As that theme is for Brackets only, I created a new theme for VS Code using the colours based by Delkos. There is no growing effect, only the colour highlights for the code.

This theme was made focusing in **JS, PHP, CSS and HTML**, but feel free to fork and do the changes to your preferred programming language. I can try to add support to other programming languages, but I can't promise anything.

## Installation:
- Clone or download this repository;
- Copy and Paste the content in the themes folder of VS Code
- **Linux**: `<home>/.vscode/extensions/<create-a-folder-here>`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Visual Studio Code\extensions\<create-a-folder-here>`

## Font
Brackets uses [Source Code Pro Font](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) as default font. Install it and configure VS Code to use this as default font for a much better adaptation!
